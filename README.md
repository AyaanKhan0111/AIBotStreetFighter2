## 1. Introduction

This project presents the design and implementation of an AI-driven bot for the game *Street Fighter II Turbo*. The bot replaces traditional rule-based systems using a neural network trained on gameplay data to predict optimal button presses in real time.

## 2. Objectives

* Replace static rule-based logic with a neural network.
* Support any character generically.
* Automate gameplay data collection.
* Ensure the project is easily reproducible.

## 3. Project Setup and Dependencies

**Operating System:** Windows 7 or above (64-bit)
**Python Version:** 3.6.3 (tested), compatible with Python â‰¥ 3.7
**Libraries:**

* TensorFlow
* NumPy
* pandas
* scikit-learn

**Emulator:** BizHawk (EmuHawk.exe)

**Installation Steps:**

1. Install Python and pip.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

3. Extract BizHawk and place `EmuHawk.exe` appropriately.
4. Extract source files and `model.h5` into your project folder.

## 4. Code Architecture

### 4.1 controller.py

* Handles socket communication with BizHawk.
* Logs game state to `game_data.csv`.
* Functions:

  * `connect()`, `receive()`, `send()`
  * `DataLogger` class for writing game + action data.

### 4.2 bot.py

* `Bot` class:

  * Loads `model.h5`
  * Extracts features from game state
  * Feeds features into the neural network to predict button actions

### 4.3 command.py and buttons.py

* `Buttons`: 12 SNES button states (up, down, left, right, Y, B, X, A, L, R, select, start)
* `Command`: Holds two button states and converts to JSON for socket transmission

### 4.4 game\_state.py and player.py

* `GameState`: Parses JSON into `Player` objects + match metadata
* `Player`: Attributes like health, position, move states, etc.

### 4.5 project.py

* Merges CSV files (`sfdataset*.csv`) using pandas
* Removes duplicates and saves as `sfmerged.csv`

## 5. Dataset Generation

1. Launch BizHawk in single-player mode
2. Run:

```bash
python controller.py 1
```

3. Play rounds to log human actions
4. Repeat for various characters
5. Merge datasets via `project.py`

## 6. Feature Extraction

Extracted per frame:

* Timer, flags
* Player/opponent: character ID, health, x/y position, jumping/crouching status, move ID
* 17 total features used as model inputs

## 7. Model Development and Training

**Data Preparation:**

* Boolean to integer conversion
* Split dataset (80% train, 20% test)

**Model Architecture:**

* Input: 17
* Dense(128, relu) -> Dense(64, relu) -> Dense(10, sigmoid)

**Compilation:**

* Optimizer: Adam
* Loss: Binary Crossentropy
* Metrics: Accuracy

**Training:**

* 100 epochs, batch size 32, validation split 0.1

**Model Saving:**

* Save to `model.h5`

## 8. Integration and Execution

1. Place `model.h5` in root directory
2. Launch ROM in BizHawk
3. Connect via emulator UI (Tool Box - Shift+T)
4. Run:

```bash
python controller.py [1|2]
```

5. Watch bot play and generate logs

## 9. Usage Instructions

Zip package includes:

* Source files: `.py` scripts listed above
* Trained model: `model.h5`
* Documentation: README.md or PDF/Word version

## 10. Results and Observations

* Performs coherent combos
* Occasionally fails under pressure (time constraints)
* Future improvements:

  * Fine-tune prediction thresholds
  * Add RNN/LSTM for temporal dependencies

## 11. Conclusion

The project effectively demonstrates how AI can replace deterministic logic in classic games. It provides a modular, scalable, and reproducible pipeline from data collection to deployment.
